Note
====

When you download the SoftActivate Licensing SDK for the first time, it runs in DEMO mode.

The demo mode of the SoftActivate Licensing SDK has the following limitations: 

The generated license keys are random, but the public/private key pairs needed 
to digitally sign the license keys are pre-defined and cannot be changed.
If you try to generate public/private key pairs, the same pair is generated every time.
